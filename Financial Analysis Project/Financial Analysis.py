"Today's data on wholesale prices should be eye-opening for the Federal Reserve, as inflation pressures still don't appear to be easing and will likely continue to be felt by the consumer in the coming months," said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
Apple Inc (AAPL.O) fell 2.7% following a U.S. court ruling in "Fortnite" creator Epic Games' antitrust lawsuit that stroke down some of the iPhone maker's restrictions on how developers can collect payments in apps.
